## üìã Requirements

### Hardware
- **GPU Required**: Google Colab with GPU acceleration enabled
- **Runtime**: Python 3 with GPU acceleration

### Software Dependencies
- Python 3
- PyTorch 2.4.1
- TorchVision 0.19.1
- PyTorch3D
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- PIL/Pillow
- scikit-image
- IPython

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Google Colab Setup
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. **Important**: Set runtime to GPU
   - Go to `Edit` ‚Üí `Notebook settings` ‚Üí `Hardware Accelerator` ‚Üí Select `GPU`
3. Run the setup cell to install all dependencies

### Local Setup (Advanced Users)
```bash
# Clone repositories
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/pifuhd
git clone https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch.git

# Install PyTorch and dependencies
pip install torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git

# Download pre-trained models
cd pifuhd
sh ./scripts/download_trained_model.sh
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Using Internet Images *(Enhanced Feature)*
1. Run the setup cell (STEP 1)
2. Use the "Uploading Image From Internet" section
3. Paste an image URL in the `image_url` field
4. The system will automatically download and process the image from the URL
5. Execute the cell to process the image
6. Download results using the download cell

**Note**: This feature allows you to process images directly from the web without manual downloading. Simply copy any image URL and paste it in the designated field.

### Method 2: Using Local Images
1. Run the setup cell (STEP 1)
2. Use the "Upload Image From Local Desktop" section
3. Upload your image file when prompted
4. The processing will start automatically
5. Download results using the download cell

## üìÅ Output Files

The system generates several output files:

- **`.obj` file**: 3D mesh model (importable to Blender, Maya, etc.)
- **`.png` file**: Rendered 2D view of the 3D model
- **`.mp4` file**: 360¬∞ rotation video of the 3D model

## üéØ Best Practices for Input Images

### Ideal Image Characteristics
- **Human Subject**: Single person clearly visible
- **Full Body**: Complete human figure preferred
- **Clear Pose**: Person should be standing upright
- **Good Lighting**: Even lighting without harsh shadows
- **Minimal Occlusion**: Avoid objects blocking the person
- **High Resolution**: Higher resolution images yield better results

### Supported Formats
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- BMP (.bmp)
- TIFF (.tiff)

## üîß Technical Details

### Pipeline Overview
1. **Pose Estimation**: Uses Lightweight Human Pose Estimation to detect human keypoints
2. **Bounding Box Generation**: Creates optimal crop regions around detected humans
3. **3D Reconstruction**: PIFuHD generates detailed 3D mesh from 2D image
4. **Post-Processing**: Renders final outputs and creates visualization videos

### Model Information
- **PIFuHD**: Facebook Research's state-of-the-art implicit function approach
- **Resolution**: Maximum 256x256 on Google Colab (higher resolutions require more VRAM)
- **Processing Time**: Typically 2-5 minutes per image on Colab GPU

## üìä Performance & Limitations

### System Limitations
- **Resolution Cap**: 256x256 maximum on Google Colab
- **Single Person**: Works best with single human subjects
- **Pose Requirements**: Standing poses work better than sitting/lying
- **GPU Memory**: Limited by Colab's GPU memory allocation

### Performance Tips
- Use high-quality input images
- Ensure person is clearly visible and well-lit
- Avoid complex backgrounds when possible
- Standing/walking poses generally work better

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No pose detected"
- **Solution**: Ensure the image contains a clearly visible human figure
- Check image quality and lighting

**Issue**: "GPU out of memory"
- **Solution**: Restart runtime and try again
- Use smaller input images

**Issue**: "Download files not found"
- **Solution**: Wait for processing to complete
- Check if pose estimation step succeeded

**Issue**: "Checkpoint download failed"
- **Solution**: Check internet connection
- Try running setup cell again

### Debug Information
The notebook includes comprehensive error checking and will provide detailed information about any processing failures.
